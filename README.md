For all the methods in Library class, unit testing has been done with full coverage, which include implementation of following concepts : 

- Testing specific annotations such as @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @BeforeAll, @AfterAll, @Test, etc.
- JUnit and Hamcrest assertions such as assertEquals, assertThat, assertNull, etc. To handle pass and fail case scenarios for all the specific module testcases.
- Using Mockito mocking framework to test date specific testcases.
